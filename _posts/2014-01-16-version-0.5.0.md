#### New Features:
* Notifications when reparations and constructions finish
* Repair and Construction timers tick down in real-time

#### Improvements:
* **Mac Viewer:** Application startup is a whole lot faster

#### Fixed:
* Sorting ships by stats was done alphabetically, not numerically (putting 3 after 29, etc) - [#9](https://github.com/KanColleTool/KanColleTool/issues/9)
* Cancelling the "Enter API Link" dialog popped up errors about malformed JSON - [#4](https://github.com/KanColleTool/KanColleTool/issues/4)
