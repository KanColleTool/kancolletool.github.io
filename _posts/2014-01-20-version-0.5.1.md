Is now up. As usual, you can grab it from the [downloads page](/downloads/).  
This is just a minor bug fix version, so don't expect too much...

* Fixes a bunch of UI bugs in the Tool
* Qt version requirement lowered from 5.2 to 5.0, since some Linux distros still don't stock 5.2 \*cough\*Ubuntu\*cough\*;  
  You need 5.2 to get full performance, but it's not /that/ big of a difference
* More appropriate program file names, depending on the platform
