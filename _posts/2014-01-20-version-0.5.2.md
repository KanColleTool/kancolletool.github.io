Second release today, sorry.  
More bugfixes, and you should definitely upgrade, since the Construction page was broken in 0.5.0 and 0.5.1 thanks to the API being inconsistent again.

**0.5.2:**

* Fixes the construction page, it now actually works
* Fixes countdowns on the Repairs page that keep on counting down from 23:59:59 once a reparation was finished
* Fixes a bunch of layout issues causing things to jump around
* The Tool now quits on Ctrl+Q on Windows and Linux too

**0.5.1:**

* Fixes a bunch of UI bugs in the Tool
* Qt version requirement lowered from 5.2 to 5.0, since some Linux distros still don't stock 5.2 \*cough\*Ubuntu\*cough\*;  
  You need 5.2 to get full performance, but it's not /that/ big of a difference
* More appropriate program file names, depending on the platform
