I just realized I completely forgot to update the downloads page!  
Those of you who downloaded it and can't get the English translation working: please redownload.  
You probably have Version **0.5.2** instead of **0.6.0**.

The link in the post was the right one, the one on the downloads page to the last version.  
Really sorry about that...
