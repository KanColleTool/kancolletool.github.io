The big feature of this translation is obviously the **ENGLISH TRANSLATION OF THE GAME**!  
Brought to you together with <a href="http://twitter.com/sikarra" target="_blank">Sikarra</a>, translation by Commie.

*EDIT:* I forgot to mention that the grayed-out checkbox in the Tool is intentional, and will be available in the next version.

* **ENGLISH TRANSLATION!**
* Massive speedup of the Viewer, especially on OSX
* Configurable, periodic autorefreshing in the Tool
* Better UI in the Tool
* A lot of little bugs fixed

Also a big thanks to Mary for catching my screwup with the translation code.
