Now that KanColle is back in business (for now), I'd like to push this out.  
After the maintenance, there was a ban wave aimed towards cheaters. People got nervous, so I thought I'd go over KCT and change the User-Agent string it sends with requests to pretend to be Google Chrome.

KCT is now virtually undetectable on their end (indistinguishable from Google Chrome 32.0 running on Windows 8, of all things), and should thus be banhammerproof. Note that they can still ban you for being a foreign player or cheating, of course.

Oh, and it fixes a bug where you couldn't change API link in the tool under some circumstances (particularily on OSX).
