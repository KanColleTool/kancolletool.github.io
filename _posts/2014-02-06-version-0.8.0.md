Big update right here!  
The big feature of this release is Expedition notifications, and statuses on the fleet page.

As an extra bonus, have some hotkeys.  
**Ctrl+&lt;num&gt;** switches pages (Fleets, Ships, Repairs and Constructions), and just **&lt;num&gt;** switches fleets.

#### New Features:

* Status display for fleets (baths and expeditions), with countdowns
* Expedition notifications
* Keyboard shortcuts; Ctrl+&lt;num&gt; to switch page, &lt;num&gt; to switch fleet
* Smaller fonts and margins to make sure all names can fit, even on Windows

#### Fixed:

* A bunch of crashes in the tool from race conditions and null pointer dereferences
* Instant repair buckets now don't result in bugged notifications getting shown when the reparation would normally have finished
* Construction notices don't reveal the name of the built ship unless "Spoil me" is checked for that dock
