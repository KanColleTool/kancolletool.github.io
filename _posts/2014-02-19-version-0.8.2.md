First, configuration file directories have moved from ```<configdir>/MacaroniCode``` to
```<configdir>/KanColleTool```. Unfortunately, this means that too keep your old
settings, you'll have to move that ```<configdir>/MacaroniCode``` to
```<configdir>/KanColleTool```. The configuration files are in:
 - Linux: ```$HOME/.config/```
 - Mac OS X: ```$HOME/Library/Preferences/```
 - Windows: On windows, settings are stored in the registry. Open up regedit.exe
   and rename ```HKCU\Software\MacaroniCode``` to ```KanColleTool```

Second, the viewer now modifies times sent by the server so that you can have your
system time set to whatever you like.

Next, translation is now togglable and is cached locally.

Finally, this update also marks a rather large backend change - instead of using
a proxy to do translation and forward requests to the tool, it's now being done
within the app using a custom QNetworkReply. Expect faster speeds and less
overhead :).
