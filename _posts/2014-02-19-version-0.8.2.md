With 0.8.2, a large part of the application's backend has been rewritten, mostly thanks to [@Sauyon](https://github.com/Sauyon) joining the project. Expect it to perform better and crash less.

There are two changes in this version that you may want to be aware of though:

* If you want the game translated, you must now manually enable it
* Settings are now stored in a new location, follow the instructions below to import your old ones

#### Importing settings from a previous version

**OS X:** Navigate to "~/Library/Preferences/" (Open a Finder window, press Shift+Cmd+G, copypaste that and press Enter), rename `com.macaronicode.KanColleTool.plist` to `com.kancolletool.KanColleTool.plist`, and `com.macaronicode.KCTViewer.plist` to `com.kancolletool.KCTViewer.plist`.

**Windows:**
Open the Registry Editor (Press Win+R, type "regedit", press Enter), navigate down to `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\MacaroniCode` and rename the `MacaroniCode` node to `KanColleTool`.

**Linux:**
Navigate to `~/.config/` (your file manager should have a way to jump to a given path), and rename the `MacaroniCode` directory to `KanColleTool`. Alternatively, run `mv ~/.config/MacaroniCode/ ~/.config/KanColleTool/` in a terminal.

#### New Features:
 - The client now adjusts its apparent time to JST - no need to set your computer's clock anymore
 - New in-band response interception; no more need for a proxy (this is faster and more stable)
 - You can now enable or disable the translation
 - Reset button in the Game menu

#### Fixed:
 - Crashes due to the proxy
 - Configuration is stored in a better location
 - Data is now guaranteed to be updated after maintenance on OSX
 - Certain strings being replaced by "[null]" on OSX after a recent Translation API update
