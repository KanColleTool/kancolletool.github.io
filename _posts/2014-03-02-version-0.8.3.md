Just a few quick bug fixes that slipped in with 0.8.2, sorry.

#### Fixed:
 - Increased the cache size on Windows and Linux (this means less reloading)
 - Fixed a bug in the cache on OSX that made resource loading lag
 - The Tool Settings dialog now makes sense again (0.8.2 had help texts in the wrong place)
 - You can no longer open multiple instances of the Tool
