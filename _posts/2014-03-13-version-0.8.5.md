This release has been delayed a lot by schedule issues and project restructuring. The last version was a bit rough around the edges, but this one should hopefully be less so.

### Added

* Screen in the Tool telling you when it's expecting livestreamed data (instead of staying blank until it gets some)
* Proxy settings in the Viewer on Windows and Linux (on Mac, use the system's proxy settings instead)
* Mac OS X 10.8 support

### Improved

* The Tool's Fleets screen reworked to look a lot better
* The Tool's refresh interval is now given in minutes, rather than seconds
* The Mac viewer loads resources faster

### Fixed

* Various Tool UI bugs
* Window icons are now properly shown
* The Tool no longer waits for data to be received on startup
* The game's loading screen now has a black background like on the official page
* The Viewer occasionally failing to start on Mac
