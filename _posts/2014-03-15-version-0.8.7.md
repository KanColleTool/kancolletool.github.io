Just a quick update that works around a Flash Player bug that affected Windows users with a reasonably up-to-date Flash Player version. Due to issues with how Direct Rendering Mode is implemented on Windows, the game jumped up a bit and covered the viewer menus, in a way that shouldn't even be possible...

This update simply disables Direct Rendering Mode until I figure out a good way to safely enable it again.
