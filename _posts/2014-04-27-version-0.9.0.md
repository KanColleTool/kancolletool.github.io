It took a while, but now it's here: the big KCT update to accompany the game's Spring patch.  
Along with improved compatibility, it also features quite a few improvements, particularly for Windows users.

#### Improved

* Full compatibility with KanColle's spring patch
* The Tool stopped [looking like shit](http://i.imgur.com/R9RNNP1.png) on Windows and now looks [way better](http://i.imgur.com/JkflbcI.png)
* The Viewer now shows loading progress [in the taskbar](https://i.imgur.com/aD0V5GH.png) on Windows

#### Added

* Settings for which notifications to show
* Optional reminders when you don't have any expeditions out for *x* minutes

#### Fixed

* Notification for task completion now show correctly again
