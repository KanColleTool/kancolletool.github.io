Quick bug fix update, that sadly got released way past due date...  
We're horribly understaffed, and I got flooded with RL work. Sorry about that.

---

### Fixed
* **The Tool crashing on launch**  
This was caused by a serverside change, which uncovered a bug in our property extraction code.  
It got better though, and changes in the future shouldn't cause crashiness.

* **Invisible tray icon for the tool on Mac and Linux**  
Case sensitive filesystems are so picky!  
(read: we renamed a file and forgot to change a reference to it.)

* **The Mac Viewer always insisting that it's outdated, even when it's not**  
Quick and dirty fix, a proper one coming in the next update.

### Added
* **Take screenshots in the Viewer (Windows/Linux only)**  
Note that this is almost completely untested, and may not work properly. It wasn't supposed to be released until the next version, but the Tool's crash issues forced me to release this earlier than intended...
