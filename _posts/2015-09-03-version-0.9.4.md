Wow, it's been a while, but here's an update (finally). The release was actually ready(ish) a good week ago, but we had trouble actually getting release builds packaged properly...

### Fixed:

* Translation files not loading

### Added:

* You can now get an API link straight from the Viewer
* Region cookie hack to avoid the need for a proxy/VPN (use at your own risk!)
* New options for how screenshots are saved
