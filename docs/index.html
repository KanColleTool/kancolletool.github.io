<h1>Documentation</h1>
<p class="partwidth">
	This page contains documentation about KanColleTool, and information about KanColle's internals obtained by reverse-engineering the game.
</p>
<p class="partwidth">
	If you figure anything else out, please edit <code>/_data/api.yml</code> to document it and send us a pull request, or just tell us what you found somehow. I'll probably figure out a good way to do that sooner or later.
