<h1>FAQ</h1>

<h2>Q: What is KanColleTool?</h2>
<p>
	KanColleTool is two things.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>A viewer</strong> for the game, a convenient launcher optimized specifically for KanColle.<br />
	If you're using Flash Player Standalone for the game, think that, but better.<br />
	As an extra bonus, it'll translate the game into English for you (using Commie's translation data, provided by Sikarra).
</p>
<p>
	<strong>A tool</strong> to view information the game doesn't show you, and information it does show you in a more convenient way.<br />
	It's a small window that stays quietly in the tray when not in use, that will also notify you of completed constructions and repairs.
</p>

<h2>Q: Is this safe? Will I get banned?</h2>
<p>
	If you're a foreign player, DMM already have all the reason they need to ban you.
</p>
<p>
	Using KCT will not increase your chances of getting banned, and starting with <strong>0.7.1</strong>, not even I could tell if you're using it.<br />
	The tool and viewer will both identify as Google Chrome (in <strong>0.7.1+</strong>), so all they have to go on is the location your IP originates from.
</p>

<h2>Q: Why is the game not loading?</h2>
<p>
	You most likely do not have Flash Player installed.
</p>
<p>
	This is especially common if you use Google Chrome as your main browser, as that uses its own, embedded version of it. It's not possible to load their embedded version into another program, so you have to <a href="http://get.adobe.com/flashplayer/" target="_blank">download and install Flash Player</a> yourself before KCT will work.
</p>
<p>
	As an extra bonus, this will fix videos in Steam not loading.
</p>

<h2>Q: I started the game, why isn't it in English?</h2>
<p>
	You're most likely using an outdated version of the viewer (you need at least <strong>0.6.0</strong>), or not using it at all.
</p>
<p>
	The Viewer is called "<strong>KCT Viewer</strong>" and should be in the same place as the Tool.<br />
	KCT can't translate the game if you're playing in a browser or Flash Player/Flash Projector.
</p>

<h2>Q: Why would I want to update?</h2>
<p>
	Aside from the normal reasons (new features and bug fixes), new updates are sometimes <strong>necessary</strong> to stay under DMM's radar.
</p>
<p>
	<big><strong>tl;dr: Always update. It could be important!</strong></big>
</p>

<h2>Q: How does the English patch work?</h2>
<p>
	The patch works by laying a filter between the game and the server.<br />
	When the game requests some data from the server, this little filter (a protocol handler on OSX, a proxy on Windows and Linux), catches the response and looks up translations in a database, swaps the Japanese text out for English, and hands it back.
</p>
<p>
	The beauty of this is that the game can't tell any of this is taking place. It just displays whatever it thinks it got from the server.
</p>
<p>
	Translation data is provided by Commie (though it does NOT use their proxy-based traslator), via <a href="http://api.comeonandsl.am/" target="_blank">api.comeonandsl.am</a>.<br />
	Translation is done by <a href="http://twitter.com/RHExcelion" target="_blank">RHExcelion</a>, API by <a href="http://twitter.com/sikarra" target="_blank">sikarra</a>.
</p>

<h2>Q: Do you have any documentation I could use?</h2>
<p>
	Sure, just head over to the <a href="/docs/">Documentation</a> page. That has everything I know about how the game works.
